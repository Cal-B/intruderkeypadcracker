# Intruder Automatic Keypad Cracker
Short program using PyAutoGUI to crack keypads in the stealth PVP game Intruder, written in Python 3.8.5

Exhaustively inputs all 4 number codes from 0000 to 9999 in order to find the correct combination to a locked keypad 

## Installation 
0.  Install `pythonautogui` using pip with `pip install pyautogui`
1.  Clone this repository onto your device with `git clone https://github.com/Cal-B/intruderkeypadcracker.git`
2.  `cd` into the directory and run the program with `python autocracker.py`, you will have 5 seconds to tab back into game before the program starts.
3.  Sit back and relax, as it takes around 20 minutes to enter all possible permutations.
4.  After hearing the success chime and seeing the keypad menu close, jerk your mouse to the top left of your screeen. This will engage the PythonAutoGUI failsafe and end the program.

## Viability
This is clearly not a viable gameplay option in a normal game of Intruder as the exhaustive search takes around 20 minutes to complete. Considering that you are rattling off electronic chimes like a gatling gun in a stealth game heavily dependent on sound, this solution also gives the enemy team a perfect way to pinpoint you while you've got your hands full and can't fight back.
